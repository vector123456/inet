This folder contains many reusable modules for the purpose of traffic generation
in applications, and packet queueing, traffic shaping, and traffic policing in
network devices and communication protocols.

The available different kind of modules can be combined in many ways to create
desired complex behavior for the above purposes. In general, to avoid unexpected
runtime errors, modules validate the assembled structure during module initialization.
